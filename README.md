# Wilfred - Varsity Discord
Respository for Varsity Discord's Wilfred Bot, feel free to look over the source code here and use parts of it in your own discord bot.

# To Do:
- Clean up code [It's a mess]
- Impliment Ransack Command
- Better Suggestions System?

# Known Issues:
- Bot spams the #gate channel whenever someone does !accept (Appears it loops on trying to delete a message that doesn't exist, every 30 seconds)
- Git feed causes the bot to send an error output in #git-feed since the Webhook is not known to the database.
